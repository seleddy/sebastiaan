        <h2>You sneak down the hall and you find a rock and you throw it to distract them. While the other thing went around the corner to look for the source of the noise you quickly end the other thing standing there with his back to you. As soon as that happens you go and hide in the shadows of the mossy halway. Then the other thing comes back from looking for the noise.</h2>
